# Candy.AI chat history extension for Firefox

In discussions amongst users of Candy.AI it was suggested that the AI responds better in conversations
the more chat history is loaded. Because manually scrolling up is a PITA, this extension will take care
of it for you. It is very basic and has had minimal testing, but I use it personally so if I encounter
any issues I will probably fix them pretty quick.
